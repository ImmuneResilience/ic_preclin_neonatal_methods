# Applying indirect calorimetry to study newborn metabolism

Non-invasive but yet informative tools to study host responses to sepsis in tiny neonatal mice are always welcome, and indirect calorimetry holds promise. Our group applied the Promethion Core IC system (Sable Systems) with custom RC3 chambers to measure the gas exchange in newborn mice. Since we were the first to use the system in this way, we have also put together our findings on the sensitivity, reliablitity of the Promethion, together with the impact on animal welfare.  Manuscript will be linked to this repo soon, but for now it holds all the data and scripts used to produce it.
